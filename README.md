# enigma_machine_on_sagemath
Simulation of the Enigma cipher machine on SageMath using a mathematical model through permutations
1. Enigma.ipynb - code
2. pg1056.txt - the book (you can test it on another one later, just look for English and utf-8)
3. answer.txt - the file where we transfer the encoded text to
4. answer_decode.txt - file with decoded text
5. the mathematical model of the enigma machine can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine in the Mathematical analysis chapter.
