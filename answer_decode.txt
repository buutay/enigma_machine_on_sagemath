APPRECIATION FORNOBLE ENGLISH WITHAL IT INTRODUCED INTO HIS MIND MUCH THAT WAS ARCHAICAND OBSOLETETHE EIGHT MONTHS HAD BEEN WELL SPENT AND IN ADDITION TO WHAT HE HADLEARNED OF RIGHT SPEAKING AND HIGH THINKING HE HAD LEARNED MUCH OFHIMSELF ALONG WITH HIS HUMBLENESS BECAUSE HE KNEW SO LITTLE THEREAROSE A CONVICTION OF POWER HE FELT A SHARP GRADATION BETWEEN HIMSELFAND HIS SHIPMATES AND WAS WISE ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT THE DIFFERENCELAY IN POTENTIALITY RATHER THAN ACHIEVEMENT WHAT HE COULD DOTHEYCOULD DO BUT WITHIN HIM HE FELT A CONFUSED FERMENT WORKING THAT TOLDHIM THERE WAS MORE IN HIM THAN HE HAD DONE HE WAS TORTURED BY THEEXQUISITE BEAUTY OF THE WORLD AND WISHED THAT RUTH WERE THERE TO SHAREIT WITH HIM HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD DESCRIBE TO HER MANY OF THE BITSOF SOUTH SEA BEAUTY THE CREATIVE SPIRIT IN HIM FLAMED UP AT THETHOUGHT AND URGED THAT HE RECREATE THIS BEAUTY FOR A WIDER AUDIENCETHAN RUTH AND THEN IN SPLENDOR AND GLORY CAME THE GREAT IDEA HEWOULD WRITE HE WOULD BE ONE OF

DO ANYTHING IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT AND LONELYSEA HE GAINED PERSPECTIVE CLEARLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SAW RUTHAND HER WORLD IT WAS ALL VISUALIZED IN HIS MIND AS A CONCRETE THINGWHICH HE COULD TAKE UP IN HIS TWO HANDS AND TURN AROUND AND ABOUT ANDEXAMINE THERE WAS MUCH THAT WAS DIM AND NEBULOUS IN THAT WORLD BUT HESAW IT AS A WHOLE AND NOT IN DETAIL AND HE SAW ALSO THE WAY TOMASTER IT TO WRITE THE THOUGHT WAS FIRE IN HIM HE WOULD BEGIN ASSOON AS HE GOT BACK THE FIRST THING HE WOULD DO WOULD BE TO DESCRIBETHE VOYAGE OF THE TREASUREHUNTERS HE WOULD SELL IT TO SOME SANFRANCISCO NEWSPAPER HE WOULD NOT TELL RUTH ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND SHEWOULD BE SURPRISED AND PLEASED WHEN SHE SAW HIS NAME IN PRINT WHILE HEWROTE HE COULD GO ON STUDYING THERE WERE TWENTYFOUR HOURS IN EACHDAY HE WAS INVINCIBLE HE KNEW HOW TO WORK AND THE CITADELS WOULD GODOWN BEFORE HIM HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO TO SEA AGAINAS A SAILOR ANDFOR THE INSTANT HE CAUGHT A VISION OF A STEAM YACHT THERE WERE OTHERWRITERS WHO POSSESSED STEAM YACHTS OF COURSE HE CAUTIONED HIMSELF ITWOULD BE SLOW SUCCEEDING AT FIRST AND FOR A TIME HE WOULD BE CONTENTTO EARN ENOUGH MONEY BY HIS WRITING TO ENABLE HIM TO GO ON STUDYINGAND THEN AFTER SOME TIMEA VERY INDETERMINATE TIMEWHEN HE HADLEARNED AND PREPARED HIMSELF HE WOULD WRITE THE GREAT THINGS AND HISNAME WOULD BE ON ALL MENS LIPS BUT GREATER THAN THAT INFINITELYGREATER AND GREATEST OF ALL HE WOULD HAVE PROVED HIMSELF WORTHY OFRUTH FAME WAS ALL VERY WELL BUT IT WAS FOR RUTH THAT HIS SPLENDIDDREAM AROSE HE WAS NOT A FAMEMONGER BUT MERELY ONE OF GODS MADLOVERSARRIVED IN OAKLAND WITH HIS SNUG PAYDAY IN HIS POCKET HE TOOK UP HISOLD ROOM AT BERNARD HIGGINBOTHAMS AND SET TO WORK HE DID NOT EVEN LETRUTH KNOW HE WAS BACK HE WOULD GO AND SEE HER WHEN HE FINISHED THEARTICLE

TO HIM HE DID NOT KNOW HOW LONG AN ARTICLE HE SHOULD WRITE BUTHE COUNTED THE WORDS IN A DOUBLEPAGE ARTICLE IN THE SUNDAY SUPPLEMENTOF THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER AND GUIDED HIMSELF BY THAT THREEDAYS AT WHITE HEAT COMPLETED HIS NARRATIVE BUT WHEN HE HAD COPIED ITCAREFULLY IN A LARGE SCRAWL THAT WAS EASY TO READ HE LEARNED FROM ARHETORIC HE PICKED UP IN THE LIBRARY THAT THERE WERE SUCH THINGS ASPARAGRAPHS AND QUOTATION MARKS HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH THINGSBEFORE AND HE PROMPTLY SET TO WORK WRITING THE ARTICLE OVER REFERRINGCONTINUALLY TO THE PAGES OF THE RHETORIC AND LEARNING MORE IN A DAYABOUT COMPOSITION THAN THE AVERAGE SCHOOLBOY IN A YEAR WHEN HE HADCOPIED THE ARTICLE A SECOND TIME AND ROLLED IT UP CAREFULLY HE READ INA NEWSPAPER AN ITEM ON HINTS TO BEGINNERS AND DISCOVERED THE IRON LAWTHAT MANUSCRIPTS SHOULD NEVER BE ROLLED AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE WRITTENON ONE SIDE OF THE PAPER HE HAD VIOLATED THE LAW ON BOTH COUNTS ALSOHE LEARNED FROM THE ITEM THAT FIRSTCLASS PAPERS PAID A MINIMUM OF TENDOLLARS A COLUMN SO WHILE HE COPIED THE MANUSCRIPT A THIRD TIME HECONSOLED HIMSELF BY MULTIPLYING TEN COLUMNS BY TEN DOLLARS THE PRODUCTWAS ALWAYS THE SAME ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND HE DECIDED THAT THAT WASBETTER THAN SEAFARING IF IT HADNT BEEN FOR HIS BLUNDERS HE WOULDHAVE FINISHED THE ARTICLE IN THREE DAYS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THREEDAYS IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM THREE MONTHS AND LONGER ON THE SEA TOEARN A SIMILAR AMOUNT A MAN WAS A FOOL TO GO TO SEA WHEN HE COULDWRITE HE CONCLUDED THOUGH THE MONEY IN ITSELF MEANT NOTHING TO HIMITS VALUE WAS IN THE LIBERTY IT WOULD GET HIM THE PRESENTABLE GARMENTSIT WOULD BUY HIM ALL OF WHICH WOULD BRING HIM NEARER SWIFTLY NEARERTO THE SLENDER PALE GIRL WHO HAD TURNED HIS LIFE BACK UPON ITSELF ANDGIVEN HIM INSPIRATIONHE MAILED THE

NOT BEEN ANY NEWS VALUE IN HIS ARTICLE AND MOSTLIKELY THE EDITOR WOULD WRITE TO HIM ABOUT IT FIRSTAFTER BREAKFAST HE WENT ON WITH HIS SERIAL THE WORDS FLOWED FROM HISPEN THOUGH HE BROKE OFF FROM THE WRITING FREQUENTLY TO LOOK UPDEFINITIONS IN THE DICTIONARY OR TO REFER TO THE RHETORIC HE OFTENREAD OR REREAD A CHAPTER AT A TIME DURING SUCH PAUSES AND HECONSOLED HIMSELF THAT WHILE HE WAS NOT

OUTSIDE EH HIS BROTHERINLAW SNEERED YOU KNOW WHATTHAT MEANS YOULL BE IN THE POLICE COURT YETBUT MARTIN COULD NOT COME DOWN FROM THE HEIGHT NOT EVEN THE BESTIALITYOF THE ALLUSION COULD BRING HIM BACK TO EARTH ANGER AND HURT WEREBENEATH HIM HE HAD SEEN A GREAT VISION AND WAS AS A GOD AND HE COULDFEEL ONLY PROFOUND AND AWFUL PITY FOR THIS MAGGOT OF A MAN HE DID NOTLOOK AT HIM AND THOUGH HIS EYES PASSED OVER HIM HE DID NOT SEE HIMAND AS IN A DREAM HE PASSED OUT OF THE ROOM TO DRESS IT WAS NOT UNTILHE HAD REACHED HIS OWN ROOM AND WAS TYING HIS NECKTIE THAT HE BECAMEAWARE OF A SOUND THAT LINGERED UNPLEASANTLY IN HIS EARS ONINVESTIGATING THIS SOUND HE IDENTIFIED IT AS THE FINAL SNORT OF BERNARDHIGGINBOTHAM WHICH SOMEHOW HAD NOT PENETRATED TO HIS BRAIN BEFOREAS RUTHS FRONT DOOR CLOSED BEHIND THEM AND HE CAME DOWN THE STEPS WITHHER HE FOUND HIMSELF GREATLY PERTURBED IT WAS NOT UNALLOYED BLISSTAKING HER TO THE LECTURE HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO HE HADSEEN ON THE STREETS WITH PERSONS OF HER CLASS THAT THE WOMEN TOOKTHE MENS ARMS BUT THEN AGAIN HE HAD SEEN THEM WHEN THEY DIDNT ANDHE WONDERED IF IT WAS ONLY IN THE EVENING THAT ARMS WERE TAKEN OR ONLYBETWEEN HUSBANDS AND WIVES AND RELATIVESJUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE SIDEWALK HE REMEMBERED MINNIE MINNIE HADALWAYS BEEN A STICKLER SHE HAD CALLED HIM DOWN THE SECOND TIME SHEWALKED OUT WITH HIM BECAUSE HE HAD GONE ALONG ON THE INSIDE AND SHEHAD LAID THE LAW DOWN TO HIM THAT A GENTLEMAN ALWAYS WALKED ON THEOUTSIDEWHEN HE WAS WITH A LADY AND MINNIE HAD MADE A PRACTICE OFKICKING HIS HEELS WHENEVER THEY CROSSED FROM ONE SIDE OF THE STREET TOTHE OTHER TO REMIND HIM TO GET OVER ON THE OUTSIDE HE WONDERED WHERESHE HAD GOT THAT ITEM OF ETIQUETTE AND WHETHER IT HAD FILTERED DOWNFROM ABOVE AND WAS ALL RIGHTIT WOULDNT DO ANY HARM TO TRY IT HE DECIDED BY THE TIME THEY HADREACHED THE SIDEWALK AND HE SWUNG BEHIND RUTH AND TOOK UP HIS STATIONON THE OUTSIDE THEN THE OTHER PROBLEM PRESENTED ITSELF SHOULD HEOFFER HER HIS ARM HE HAD NEVER OFFERED ANYBODY HIS ARM IN HIS LIFETHE GIRLS HE HAD KNOWN NEVER TOOK THE FELLOWS ARMS FOR THE FIRSTSEVERAL TIMES THEY WALKED FREELY SIDE BY SIDE AND AFTER THAT IT WASARMS AROUND THE WAISTS AND HEADS AGAINST THE FELLOWS SHOULDERS WHERETHE STREETS WERE UNLIGHTED BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT SHE WASNT THATKIND OF A GIRL HE MUST DO SOMETHINGHE CROOKED THE ARM NEXT TO HERCROOKED IT VERY SLIGHTLY AND WITH SECRETTENTATIVENESS NOT INVITINGLY BUT JUST CASUALLY AS THOUGH HE WASACCUSTOMED TO WALK THAT WAY AND THEN THE WONDERFUL THING HAPPENED HEFELT HER HAND UPON HIS ARM DELICIOUS THRILLS RAN THROUGH HIM AT THECONTACT AND FOR A FEW SWEET MOMENTS IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD LEFT THESOLID EARTH AND WAS FLYING WITH HER THROUGH THE AIR BUT HE WAS SOONBACK AGAIN PERTURBED BY A NEW COMPLICATION THEY WERE CROSSING THESTREET THIS WOULD PUT HIM ON THE INSIDE HE SHOULD BE ON THE OUTSIDESHOULD HE THEREFORE DROP HER ARM AND CHANGE OVER AND IF HE DID SOWOULD HE HAVE TO REPEAT THE MANOEUVRE THE NEXT TIME AND THE NEXTTHERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT IT AND HE RESOLVED NOT TO CAPER ABOUTAND PLAY THE FOOL YET HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS CONCLUSION ANDWHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE INSIDE HE TALKED QUICKLY AND EARNESTLYMAKING A SHOW OF BEING CARRIED AWAY BY WHAT HE WAS SAYING SO THAT INCASE HE WAS WRONG IN NOT CHANGING SIDES HIS ENTHUSIASM WOULD SEEM THECAUSE FOR HIS CARELESSNESSAS THEY CROSSED

WARM AFTERNOONS THAT WASRESPONSIBLE FOR THE GREAT DISCOVERY ONCE OR TWICE IN THE MONTH WHILERIDING THROUGH THE PARK ON HIS WAY TO THE LIBRARY MARTIN DISMOUNTEDFROM HIS WHEEL AND LISTENED TO THE ARGUMENTS AND EACH TIME HE TOREHIMSELF AWAY RELUCTANTLY THE TONE OF DISCUSSION WAS MUCH LOWER THAN ATMR MORSES TABLE THE MEN WERE NOT GRAVE AND DIGNIFIED THEY LOSTTHEIR TEMPERS EASILY AND CALLED ONE ANOTHER NAMES WHILE OATHS ANDOBSCENE ALLUSIONS WERE FREQUENT ON THEIR LIPS ONCE OR TWICE HE HADSEEN THEM COME TO BLOWS AND YET HE KNEW NOT WHY THERE SEEMEDSOMETHING VITAL ABOUT THE STUFF OF THESE MENS

IDEAS WITHPRIMITIVE ANGER SEEMED SOMEHOW TO BE MORE ALIVE THAN MR MORSE AND HISCRONY MR BUTLERMARTIN HAD HEARD HERBERT SPENCER QUOTED SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PARK BUTONE AFTERNOON A DISCIPLE OF SPENCERS APPEARED A SEEDY TRAMP WITH ADIRTY COAT BUTTONED TIGHTLY AT THE THROAT TO CONCEAL THE ABSENCE OF ASHIRT BATTLE ROYAL WAS WAGED AMID THE SMOKING OF MANY CIGARETTES ANDTHE EXPECTORATION OF MUCH TOBACCOJUICE WHEREIN THE TRAMP SUCCESSFULLYHELD HIS OWN EVEN WHEN A SOCIALIST WORKMAN SNEERED THERE IS NO GODBUT THE UNKNOWABLE AND HERBERT SPENCER IS HIS PROPHET MARTIN WASPUZZLED AS TO WHAT THE DISCUSSION WAS ABOUT BUT WHEN HE RODE ON TO THELIBRARY HE CARRIED WITH HIM A NEWBORN INTEREST IN HERBERT SPENCER ANDBECAUSE OF THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THE TRAMP HAD MENTIONED FIRSTPRINCIPLES MARTIN DREW OUT THAT VOLUMESO THE GREAT DISCOVERY BEGAN ONCE BEFORE HE HAD TRIED SPENCER ANDCHOOSING THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY TO BEGIN WITH HE HAD FAILED ASABJECTLY AS HE HAD FAILED WITH MADAM BLAVATSKY THERE HAD BEEN NOUNDERSTANDING THE BOOK AND HE HAD RETURNED IT UNREAD BUT THIS NIGHTAFTER ALGEBRA AND PHYSICS AND AN ATTEMPT AT A SONNET HE GOT INTO BEDAND OPENED FIRST PRINCIPLES MORNING FOUND HIM STILL READING IT WASIMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SLEEP NOR DID HE WRITE THAT DAY HE LAY ON THEBED TILL HIS BODY GREW TIRED WHEN HE TRIED THE HARD FLOOR READING ONHIS BACK THE BOOK HELD IN THE AIR ABOVE HIM OR CHANGING FROM SIDE TOSIDE HE SLEPT THAT NIGHT AND DID HIS WRITING NEXT MORNING AND THENTHE BOOK TEMPTED HIM AND HE FELL READING ALL AFTERNOON OBLIVIOUS TOEVERYTHING AND OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT THAT WAS THE AFTERNOON RUTHGAVE TO HIM HIS FIRST CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE IMMEDIATE WORLD ABOUT HIMWAS WHEN BERNARD HIGGINBOTHAM JERKED OPEN THE DOOR AND DEMANDED TO KNOWIF HE THOUGHT THEY WERE RUNNING A RESTAURANTMARTIN EDEN HAD BEEN MASTERED BY CURIOSITY ALL HIS DAYS HE WANTED TOKNOW AND IT WAS THIS DESIRE THAT HAD SENT HIM ADVENTURING OVER THEWORLD BUT HE WAS NOW LEARNING FROM SPENCER THAT HE NEVER HAD KNOWNAND THAT HE NEVER COULD HAVE KNOWN HAD HE CONTINUED HIS SAILING ANDWANDERING FOREVER HE HAD MERELY SKIMMED OVER THE SURFACE OF THINGSOBSERVING DETACHED PHENOMENA ACCUMULATING FRAGMENTS OF FACTS MAKINGSUPERFICIAL LITTLE GENERALIZATIONSAND ALL AND EVERYTHING QUITEUNRELATED IN A CAPRICIOUS AND DISORDERLY WORLD OF WHIM AND CHANCE THEMECHANISM OF THE FLIGHT OF BIRDS HE HAD WATCHED AND REASONED ABOUT WITHUNDERSTANDING BUT IT HAD NEVER ENTERED HIS HEAD TO TRY TO EXPLAIN THEPROCESS WHEREBY BIRDS AS ORGANIC FLYING MECHANISMS HAD BEENDEVELOPED HE HAD NEVER DREAMED THERE WAS SUCH A PROCESS THAT BIRDSSHOULD HAVE COME TO BE WAS UNGUESSED THEY ALWAYS HAD BEEN THEY JUSTHAPPENEDAND AS IT WAS WITH BIRDS SO HAD IT BEEN WITH EVERYTHING HIS IGNORANTAND UNPREPARED ATTEMPTS AT PHILOSOPHY HAD BEEN FRUITLESS THE MEDIEVALMETAPHYSICS OF KANT HAD GIVEN HIM THE KEY TO NOTHING AND HAD SERVEDTHE SOLE PURPOSE OF MAKING HIM DOUBT HIS OWN INTELLECTUAL POWERS INSIMILAR MANNER HIS ATTEMPT TO STUDY EVOLUTION HAD BEEN CONFINED TO AHOPELESSLY TECHNICAL VOLUME BY ROMANES HE HAD UNDERSTOOD NOTHING ANDTHE ONLY IDEA HE HAD GATHERED WAS THAT EVOLUTION WAS A DRYASDUSTTHEORY OF A LOT OF LITTLE MEN POSSESSED OF HUGE AND UNINTELLIGIBLEVOCABULARIES AND NOW HE LEARNED THAT EVOLUTION WAS NO MERE THEORY BUTAN ACCEPTED PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT THAT SCIENTISTS NO LONGER DISAGREEDABOUT IT THEIR ONLY DIFFERENCES BEING OVER THE METHOD OF EVOLUTIONAND HERE WAS THE MAN SPENCER ORGANIZING ALL KNOWLEDGE FOR HIMREDUCING EVERYTHING TO UNITY ELABORATING ULTIMATE REALITIES ANDPRESENTING TO HIS STARTLED GAZE A UNIVERSE SO CONCRETE OF REALIZATIONTHAT IT WAS LIKE THE MODEL OF A SHIP SUCH AS SAILORS MAKE AND PUT INTOGLASS BOTTLES THERE WAS NO CAPRICE NO CHANCE ALL WAS LAW IT WAS INOBEDIENCE TO LAW THAT THE BIRD FLEW AND IT WAS IN OBEDIENCE TO THESAME LAW THAT FERMENTING SLIME HAD WRITHED AND SQUIRMED AND PUT OUTLEGS AND WINGS AND BECOME A BIRDMARTIN HAD ASCENDED FROM PITCH TO PITCH OF INTELLECTUAL LIVING ANDHERE HE WAS AT A HIGHER PITCH THAN EVER ALL THE HIDDEN THINGS WERELAYING THEIR SECRETS BARE HE WAS DRUNKEN WITH COMPREHENSION AT NIGHTASLEEP HE LIVED WITH THE GODS IN COLOSSAL NIGHTMARE AND AWAKE IN THEDAY HE WENT AROUND LIKE A SOMNAMBULIST WITH ABSENT STARE GAZING UPONTHE WORLD HE HAD JUST DISCOVERED AT TABLE HE FAILED TO HEAR THECONVERSATION ABOUT PETTY AND IGNOBLE THINGS HIS EAGER MIND SEEKING OUTAND FOLLOWING CAUSE AND EFFECT IN EVERYTHING BEFORE HIM IN THE MEAT ONTHE PLATTER HE SAW THE SHINING SUN AND TRACED ITS ENERGY BACK THROUGHALL ITS TRANSFORMATIONS TO ITS SOURCE A HUNDRED MILLION MILES AWAY ORTRACED ITS ENERGY AHEAD TO THE MOVING MUSCLES IN HIS ARMS THAT ENABLEDHIM TO CUT THE MEAT AND TO THE BRAIN WHEREWITH HE WILLED THE MUSCLESTO MOVE TO CUT THE MEAT UNTIL WITH INWARD GAZE HE SAW THE SAME SUNSHINING IN HIS BRAIN HE WAS ENTRANCED BY ILLUMINATION AND DID NOTHEAR THE BUGHOUSE WHISPERED BY JIM NOR SEE THE ANXIETY ON HISSISTERS FACE NOR NOTICE THE ROTARY MOTION OF BERNARD HIGGINBOTHAMSFINGER WHEREBY HE IMPARTED THE SUGGESTION OF WHEELS REVOLVING IN HISBROTHERINLAWS HEADWHAT IN A WAY MOST PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED MARTIN WAS THE CORRELATIONOF KNOWLEDGEOF ALL KNOWLEDGE HE HAD BEEN CURIOUS TO KNOW THINGS ANDWHATEVER HE ACQUIRED HE HAD FILED AWAY IN SEPARATE MEMORY COMPARTMENTSIN HIS BRAIN THUS ON THE SUBJECT OF SAILING HE HAD AN IMMENSE STOREON THE SUBJECT OF WOMAN HE HAD A FAIRLY LARGE STORE BUT THESE TWOSUBJECTS HAD BEEN UNRELATED BETWEEN THE TWO MEMORY COMPARTMENTS THEREHAD BEEN NO CONNECTION THAT IN THE FABRIC OF KNOWLEDGE THERE SHOULDBE ANY CONNECTION WHATEVER BETWEEN A WOMAN WITH HYSTERICS AND ASCHOONER CARRYING A WEATHERHELM OR HEAVING TO IN A GALE WOULD HAVESTRUCK HIM AS RIDICULOUS AND IMPOSSIBLE BUT HERBERT SPENCER HAD SHOWNHIM NOT ONLY THAT IT WAS NOT RIDICULOUS BUT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FORTHERE TO BE NO CONNECTION ALL THINGS WERE RELATED TO ALL OTHER THINGSFROM THE FARTHERMOST STAR IN THE WASTES OF SPACE TO THE MYRIADS OFATOMS IN THE GRAIN OF SAND UNDER ONES FOOT THIS NEW CONCEPT WAS APERPETUAL AMAZEMENT TO MARTIN AND HE FOUND HIMSELF ENGAGED CONTINUALLYIN TRACING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALL THINGS UNDER THE SUN AND ON THEOTHER SIDE OF THE SUN HE DREW UP LISTS OF THE MOST INCONGRUOUS THINGSAND WAS UNHAPPY UNTIL HE SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING KINSHIP BETWEEN THEMALLKINSHIP BETWEEN LOVE POETRY EARTHQUAKE FIRE

ARTHUR AND NORMAN HE FOUND BELIEVED INEVOLUTION AND HAD READ SPENCER THOUGH IT DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE MADE ANYVITAL IMPRESSION UPON THEM WHILE THE YOUNG FELLOW WITH THE GLASSES ANDTHE MOP OF HAIR WILL OLNEY SNEERED DISAGREEABLY AT SPENCER ANDREPEATED THE EPIGRAM THERE IS NO GOD BUT THE UNKNOWABLE AND HERBERTSPENCER IS HIS PROPHETBUT MARTIN FORGAVE HIM THE SNEER FOR HE HAD BEGUN TO DISCOVER THATOLNEY WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH RUTH LATER HE WAS DUMFOUNDED TO LEARN FROMVARIOUS LITTLE HAPPENINGS NOT ONLY THAT OLNEY DID NOT CARE FOR RUTHBUT THAT HE HAD A POSITIVE DISLIKE FOR HER MARTIN COULD NOT UNDERSTANDTHIS IT WAS A BIT OF PHENOMENA THAT HE COULD NOT CORRELATE WITH ALLTHE REST OF THE PHENOMENA IN THE UNIVERSE BUT NEVERTHELESS HE FELTSORRY FOR THE YOUNG FELLOW BECAUSE OF THE GREAT LACK IN HIS NATURE THATPREVENTED HIM FROM A PROPER APPRECIATION OF RUTHS FINENESS AND BEAUTYTHEY RODE OUT INTO THE HILLS SEVERAL SUNDAYS ON THEIR WHEELS ANDMARTIN HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE THE ARMED TRUCE THAT EXISTEDBETWEEN RUTH AND OLNEY THE LATTER CHUMMED WITH NORMAN THROWING ARTHURAND MARTIN INTO COMPANY WITH RUTH FOR WHICH MARTIN WAS DULY GRATEFULTHOSE SUNDAYS WERE GREAT DAYS FOR MARTIN GREATEST BECAUSE HE WAS WITHRUTH AND GREAT ALSO BECAUSE THEY WERE PUTTING HIM MORE ON A PAR WITHTHE YOUNG MEN OF HER CLASS IN SPITE OF THEIR LONG YEARS OF DISCIPLINEDEDUCATION HE WAS FINDING HIMSELF THEIR INTELLECTUAL EQUAL AND THEHOURS SPENT WITH THEM IN CONVERSATION WAS SO MUCH PRACTICE FOR HIM INTHE USE OF THE GRAMMAR HE HAD STUDIED SO HARD HE HAD ABANDONED THEETIQUETTE BOOKS FALLING BACK UPON OBSERVATION TO SHOW HIM THE RIGHTTHINGS TO DO EXCEPT WHEN CARRIED AWAY BY HIS ENTHUSIASM HE WAS ALWAYSON GUARD KEENLY WATCHFUL OF THEIR ACTIONS AND LEARNING THEIR LITTLECOURTESIES AND REFINEMENTS OF CONDUCTTHE FACT THAT SPENCER WAS VERY LITTLE READ WAS FOR SOME TIME A SOURCEOF SURPRISE TO MARTIN HERBERT SPENCER SAID THE MAN AT THE DESK INTHE LIBRARY OH YES A GREAT MIND BUT THE MAN DID NOT SEEM TO KNOWANYTHING OF THE CONTENT OF THAT GREAT MIND ONE EVENING AT DINNERWHEN MR BUTLER WAS THERE MARTIN TURNED THE CONVERSATION UPON SPENCERMR MORSE BITTERLY ARRAIGNED THE ENGLISH PHILOSOPHERS AGNOSTICISM BUTCONFESSED THAT HE HAD NOT READ FIRST PRINCIPLES WHILE MR BUTLERSTATED THAT HE HAD NO PATIENCE WITH SPENCER HAD NEVER READ A LINE OFHIM AND HAD MANAGED TO GET ALONG QUITE WELL WITHOUT HIM DOUBTS AROSEIN MARTINS MIND AND HAD HE BEEN LESS STRONGLY INDIVIDUAL HE WOULDHAVE ACCEPTED THE GENERAL OPINION AND GIVEN HERBERT SPENCER UP AS ITWAS HE FOUND SPENCERS EXPLANATION OF THINGS CONVINCING AND AS HEPHRASED IT TO HIMSELF TO GIVE UP SPENCER WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO ANAVIGATOR THROWING THE COMPASS AND CHRONOMETER OVERBOARD SO MARTINWENT ON INTO A THOROUGH STUDY OF EVOLUTION MASTERING MORE AND MORE

HEALTH OF MARTIN HE TOO HAD BEEN TOLD OF HER CONTEMPLATEDEASTERN TRIP AND HE FELT THE NEED FOR HASTE YET HE DID NOT KNOW HOWTO MAKE LOVE TO A GIRL LIKE RUTH THEN TOO HE WAS HANDICAPPED BY THEPOSSESSION OF A GREAT FUND OF EXPERIENCE WITH GIRLS AND WOMEN WHO HADBEEN ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT FROM HER THEY HAD KNOWN ABOUT LOVE AND LIFEAND FLIRTATION WHILE SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT SUCH THINGS HERPRODIGIOUS INNOCENCE APPALLED HIM FREEZING ON HIS LIPS ALL ARDORS OFSPEECH AND CONVINCING HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF OF HIS OWNUNWORTHINESS ALSO HE WAS HANDICAPPED IN ANOTHER WAY HE HAD HIMSELFNEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE HE HAD LIKED WOMEN IN THAT TURGID PAST OFHIS AND BEEN FASCINATED BY SOME OF THEM BUT HE HAD NOT KNOWN WHAT ITWAS TO LOVE THEM HE HAD WHISTLED IN A MASTERFUL CARELESS WAY ANDTHEY HAD COME TO HIM THEY HAD BEEN DIVERSIONS INCIDENTS PART OF THEGAME MEN PLAY BUT A SMALL PART AT MOST AND NOW AND FOR THE FIRSTTIME HE WAS A SUPPLIANT TENDER AND TIMID AND DOUBTING HE DID NOTKNOW THE WAY OF LOVE NOR ITS SPEECH WHILE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AT HISLOVED ONES CLEAR INNOCENCEIN THE COURSE OF GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH A VARIED WORLD WHIRLING ONTHROUGH THE EVER CHANGING PHASES OF IT HE HAD LEARNED A RULE OFCONDUCT WHICH WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT WHEN ONE PLAYED A STRANGE GAME HESHOULD LET THE OTHER FELLOW PLAY FIRST THIS HAD STOOD HIM IN GOODSTEAD A THOUSAND TIMES AND TRAINED HIM AS AN

APPEALED IN PART TO HERJUDGMENT BUT THE TOUCH OF HAND THE FLEETING CONTACT MADE ITS WAYDIRECTLY TO HER INSTINCT HER JUDGMENT WAS AS YOUNG AS SHE BUT HERINSTINCTS WERE AS OLD AS THE RACE AND OLDER THEY

THE APPEAL MARTIN MADEFROM MOMENT TO MOMENT TO HER LOVENATURE THAT HE LOVED HER ON THEOTHER HAND WAS AS CLEAR AS DAY AND SHE CONSCIOUSLY DELIGHTED INBEHOLDING HIS LOVEMANIFESTATIONSTHE GLOWING EYES WITH THEIR TENDERLIGHTS THE TREMBLING HANDS AND THE NEVER FAILING SWARTHY FLUSH THATFLOODED DARKLY UNDER HIS SUNBURN SHE EVEN WENT FARTHER IN A TIMID WAYINCITING HIM BUT DOING IT SO DELICATELY THAT HE NEVER SUSPECTED ANDDOING IT HALFCONSCIOUSLY SO THAT SHE SCARCELY SUSPECTED HERSELF SHETHRILLED WITH THESE PROOFS OF HER POWER THAT PROCLAIMED HER A WOMANAND SHE TOOK AN EVELIKE DELIGHT IN TORMENTING

TAKEN HE HAD SPENT MANY HOURS IN SELFANALYSIS ANDTHEREBY LEARNED MUCH OF HIMSELF HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT HE LOVED BEAUTYMORE THAN FAME AND THAT WHAT DESIRE HE HAD FOR FAME WAS LARGELY FORRUTHS SAKE IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT HIS DESIRE FOR FAME WASSTRONG HE WANTED TO BE GREAT IN THE WORLDS EYES TO MAKE GOOD ASHE EXPRESSED IT IN ORDER THAT THE WOMAN HE LOVED SHOULD BE PROUD OFHIM AND DEEM HIM WORTHYAS FOR HIMSELF HE LOVED BEAUTY PASSIONATELY AND THE JOY OF SERVINGHER WAS TO HIM SUFFICIENT WAGE AND MORE THAN BEAUTY HE LOVED RUTH HECONSIDERED LOVE THE FINEST THING IN THE WORLD IT WAS LOVE THAT HADWORKED THE REVOLUTION IN HIM CHANGING HIM FROM AN UNCOUTH SAILOR TO ASTUDENT AND AN ARTIST THEREFORE TO HIM THE FINEST AND GREATEST OFTHE THREE GREATER THAN LEARNING AND ARTISTRY WAS LOVE ALREADY HE HADDISCOVERED THAT HIS BRAIN WENT BEYOND RUTHS JUST AS IT WENT BEYONDTHE BRAINS OF HER BROTHERS OR THE BRAIN OF HER FATHER IN SPITE OFEVERY ADVANTAGE OF UNIVERSITY TRAINING AND IN THE FACE OF HERBACHELORSHIP OF ARTS HIS POWER OF INTELLECT OVERSHADOWED HERS AND HISYEAR OR SO OF SELFSTUDY AND EQUIPMENT GAVE HIM A MASTERY OF THEAFFAIRS OF THE WORLD AND ART AND LIFE THAT SHE COULD NEVER

SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHERS HEFAVORED HE KNEW THE BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF LOVE BUT BY A REFINEDPROCESS OF THE SAME SCIENTIFIC REASONING HE REACHED THE CONCLUSION THATTHE HUMAN ORGANISM ACHIEVED ITS HIGHEST PURPOSE IN LOVE THAT LOVE MUSTNOT BE QUESTIONED BUT MUST BE ACCEPTED AS THE HIGHEST GUERDON OF LIFETHUS HE CONSIDERED THE LOVER BLESSED OVER ALL CREATURES AND IT WAS ADELIGHT TO HIM TO THINK OF GODS OWN MAD LOVER RISING ABOVE THETHINGS OF EARTH ABOVE WEALTH AND JUDGMENT PUBLIC OPINION ANDAPPLAUSE RISING ABOVE LIFE ITSELF AND DYING ON A KISSMUCH OF THIS MARTIN HAD ALREADY REASONED OUT AND

TO THE CEILING WAS HIS BICYCLE ATFIRST HE HAD TRIED TO KEEP IT IN THE BASEMENT BUT THE TRIBE OF SILVALOOSENING THE BEARINGS AND PUNCTURING THE TIRES HAD DRIVEN HIM OUTNEXT HE ATTEMPTED THE TINY FRONT PORCH UNTIL A HOWLING SOUTHEASTERDRENCHED THE WHEEL A NIGHTLONG THEN HE HAD RETREATED WITH IT TO HISROOM AND SLUNG IT ALOFTA SMALL CLOSET CONTAINED HIS CLOTHES AND THE BOOKS HE HAD ACCUMULATEDAND FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO ROOM ON THE TABLE OR UNDER THE TABLE HANDIN HAND WITH READING HE HAD DEVELOPED THE HABIT OF MAKING NOTES ANDSO COPIOUSLY DID HE MAKE THEM THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO EXISTENCEFOR HIM IN THE CONFINED QUARTERS HAD HE NOT RIGGED SEVERALCLOTHESLINES ACROSS THE ROOM ON WHICH THE NOTES WERE HUNG EVEN SO HEWAS CROWDED UNTIL NAVIGATING THE ROOM WAS A DIFFICULT TASK HE COULDNOT OPEN THE DOOR WITHOUT FIRST CLOSING THE CLOSET DOOR AND VICEVERSA IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM ANYWHERE TO TRAVERSE THE ROOM IN ASTRAIGHT LINE TO GO FROM THE DOOR TO THE HEAD OF THE BED WAS A ZIGZAGCOURSE THAT HE WAS NEVER QUITE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE DARK WITHOUTCOLLISIONS HAVING SETTLED THE DIFFICULTY OF THE CONFLICTING DOORS HEHAD TO STEER SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT TO AVOID THE KITCHEN NEXT HESHEERED TO THE LEFT TO ESCAPE THE FOOT OF THE BED BUT THIS SHEER IFTOO GENEROUS BROUGHT HIM AGAINST THE CORNER OF THE TABLE WITH ASUDDEN TWITCH AND LURCH HE TERMINATED THE SHEER AND BORE OFF TO THERIGHT ALONG A SORT OF CANAL ONE BANK OF WHICH WAS THE BED THE OTHERTHE TABLE WHEN THE ONE CHAIR IN THE ROOM WAS AT ITS USUAL PLACE BEFORETHE TABLE THE CANAL WAS UNNAVIGABLE WHEN THE CHAIR WAS NOT IN USE ITREPOSED ON TOP OF THE BED THOUGH SOMETIMES HE SAT ON THE CHAIR WHENCOOKING READING A BOOK WHILE THE WATER BOILED AND EVEN BECOMINGSKILFUL ENOUGH TO MANAGE A PARAGRAPH OR TWO WHILE STEAK WAS FRYINGALSO SO SMALL WAS THE LITTLE CORNER THAT CONSTITUTED THE KITCHEN HEWAS ABLE SITTING DOWN TO REACH ANYTHING HE NEEDED IN FACT IT WASEXPEDIENT TO COOK SITTING DOWN STANDING UP HE WAS TOO OFTEN IN HISOWN WAYIN CONJUNCTION WITH A PERFECT STOMACH THAT COULD DIGEST ANYTHING HEPOSSESSED KNOWLEDGE OF THE VARIOUS FOODS THAT WERE AT THE SAME TIMENUTRITIOUS AND CHEAP PEASOUP WAS A COMMON ARTICLE IN HIS DIET ASWELL AS POTATOES AND BEANS THE LATTER LARGE AND BROWN AND COOKED INMEXICAN STYLE RICE COOKED AS AMERICAN HOUSEWIVES NEVER COOK IT ANDCAN NEVER LEARN TO COOK IT APPEARED ON MARTINS TABLE AT LEAST ONCE ADAY DRIED FRUITS WERE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN FRESH AND HE HAD USUALLY APOT OF THEM COOKED AND READY AT HAND FOR THEY TOOK THE PLACE OFBUTTER ON HIS BREAD OCCASIONALLY HE GRACED HIS TABLE WITH A PIECE OFROUNDSTEAK OR WITH A SOUPBONE COFFEE WITHOUT CREAM OR MILK HE HADTWICE A DAY IN THE EVENING SUBSTITUTING TEA BUT BOTH COFFEE AND TEAWERE EXCELLENTLY COOKEDTHERE WAS NEED FOR HIM TO BE ECONOMICAL HIS VACATION HAD CONSUMEDNEARLY ALL HE HAD EARNED IN THE LAUNDRY AND HE WAS SO FAR FROM HISMARKET THAT WEEKS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE HE COULD HOPE FOR THE FIRSTRETURNS FROM HIS HACKWORK EXCEPT AT SUCH TIMES AS HE SAW RUTH ORDROPPED IN TO SEE HIS SISTER GERTUDE HE LIVED A RECLUSE IN EACH DAYACCOMPLISHING AT LEAST THREE DAYS LABOR OF ORDINARY MEN HE SLEPT ASCANT FIVE HOURS AND ONLY ONE WITH A CONSTITUTION OF IRON COULD HAVEHELD HIMSELF DOWN AS MARTIN DID DAY AFTER DAY TO NINETEENCONSECUTIVE HOURS OF TOIL HE NEVER LOST A MOMENT ON THE LOOKINGGLASSWERE LISTS OF DEFINITIONS AND PRONUNCIATIONS WHEN SHAVING ORDRESSING OR COMBING HIS HAIR HE CONNED THESE LISTS OVER SIMILARLISTS WERE ON THE WALL OVER THE OILSTOVE AND THEY WERE SIMILARLYCONNED WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED IN COOKING OR IN WASHING THE DISHES NEWLISTS CONTINUALLY DISPLACED THE OLD ONES EVERY STRANGE OR PARTLYFAMILIAR WORD ENCOUNTERED IN HIS READING WAS IMMEDIATELY JOTTED DOWNAND LATER WHEN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER HAD BEEN ACCUMULATED WERE TYPEDAND PINNED TO THE WALL OR LOOKINGGLASS HE EVEN CARRIED THEM IN HISPOCKETS AND REVIEWED THEM AT ODD MOMENTS ON THE STREET OR WHILEWAITING IN BUTCHER SHOP OR GROCERY TO BE SERVEDHE WENT FARTHER IN THE MATTER READING THE WORKS OF MEN WHO HADARRIVED HE NOTED EVERY RESULT ACHIEVED BY THEM AND WORKED OUT THETRICKS BY WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ACHIEVEDTHE TRICKS OF NARRATIVE OFEXPOSITION OF STYLE THE POINTS OF VIEW THE CONTRASTS THE EPIGRAMSAND OF ALL THESE HE MADE LISTS FOR STUDY HE DID NOT APE HE SOUGHTPRINCIPLES HE DREW UP LISTS OF EFFECTIVE AND FETCHING MANNERISMS TILLOUT OF MANY SUCH CULLED FROM MANY WRITERS HE WAS ABLE TO INDUCE THEGENERAL PRINCIPLE OF MANNERISM AND THUS EQUIPPED TO CAST ABOUT FORNEW AND ORIGINAL ONES OF HIS OWN AND TO WEIGH AND MEASURE AND APPRAISETHEM PROPERLY IN SIMILAR MANNER HE COLLECTED LISTS OF STRONG PHRASESTHE PHRASES OF LIVING LANGUAGE PHRASES THAT BIT LIKE ACID AND SCORCHEDLIKE FLAME OR THAT GLOWED AND WERE MELLOW AND LUSCIOUS IN THE MIDST OFTHE ARID DESERT OF COMMON SPEECH HE SOUGHT ALWAYS FOR THE PRINCIPLETHAT LAY BEHIND AND BENEATH HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW THE THING WAS DONEAFTER THAT HE COULD DO IT FOR HIMSELF HE WAS NOT CONTENT WITH THE FAIRFACE OF BEAUTY HE DISSECTED BEAUTY IN HIS CROWDED LITTLE BEDROOMLABORATORY WHERE COOKING SMELLS ALTERNATED WITH THE OUTER BEDLAM OFTHE SILVA TRIBE AND HAVING DISSECTED AND LEARNED THE ANATOMY OFBEAUTY HE WAS NEARER BEING ABLE TO CREATE BEAUTY ITSELFHE WAS SO MADE THAT HE COULD WORK ONLY WITH UNDERSTANDING HE COULD NOTWORK BLINDLY IN THE DARK IGNORANT OF WHAT HE WAS PRODUCING ANDTRUSTING TO CHANCE AND THE STAR OF HIS GENIUS THAT THE EFFECT PRODUCEDSHOULD BE RIGHT AND FINE HE HAD NO PATIENCE WITH CHANCE EFFECTS HEWANTED TO KNOW WHY AND HOW HIS WAS DELIBERATE CREATIVE GENIUS ANDBEFORE HE BEGAN A STORY OR POEM THE THING ITSELF WAS ALREADY ALIVE INHIS BRAIN WITH THE END IN SIGHT AND THE MEANS OF REALIZING THAT END INHIS CONSCIOUS POSSESSION OTHERWISE THE EFFORT WAS DOOMED TO FAILUREON THE OTHER HAND HE APPRECIATED THE CHANCE EFFECTS IN WORDS ANDPHRASES THAT CAME LIGHTLY AND EASILY INTO HIS BRAIN AND THAT LATERSTOOD ALL TESTS OF BEAUTY AND POWER AND DEVELOPED TREMENDOUS ANDINCOMMUNICABLE CONNOTATIONS BEFORE SUCH HE BOWED DOWN AND MARVELLEDKNOWING THAT THEY WERE BEYOND THE DELIBERATE CREATION OF ANY MAN ANDNO MATTER HOW MUCH HE DISSECTED BEAUTY IN SEARCH OF THE PRINCIPLES THATUNDERLIE BEAUTY AND MAKE BEAUTY POSSIBLE HE WAS AWARE ALWAYS OF THEINNERMOST MYSTERY OF BEAUTY TO WHICH HE DID NOT PENETRATE AND TO WHICHNO MAN HAD EVER PENETRATED HE KNEW FULL WELL FROM HIS SPENCER THATMAN CAN NEVER ATTAIN ULTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING AND THAT THEMYSTERY OF BEAUTY WAS NO LESS THAN THAT OF LIFENAY MORETHAT THEFIBRES OF BEAUTY AND LIFE WERE INTERTWISTED AND THAT HE HIMSELF WASBUT A BIT OF THE SAME NONUNDERSTANDABLE FABRIC TWISTED OF SUNSHINE ANDSTARDUST AND WONDERIN FACT IT WAS WHEN FILLED WITH THESE THOUGHTS THAT HE WROTE HIS ESSAYENTITLED STARDUST IN WHICH HE HAD HIS FLING NOT AT THE PRINCIPLESOF CRITICISM BUT AT THE PRINCIPAL CRITICS IT WAS BRILLIANT DEEPPHILOSOPHICAL AND DELICIOUSLY TOUCHED WITH LAUGHTER ALSO IT WASPROMPTLY REJECTED BY THE MAGAZINES AS OFTEN AS IT WAS SUBMITTED BUTHAVING CLEARED HIS MIND OF IT HE WENT SERENELY ON HIS WAY IT WAS AHABIT HE DEVELOPED OF INCUBATING AND MATURING HIS THOUGHT UPON ASUBJECT AND OF THEN RUSHING INTO THE TYPEWRITER WITH IT THAT IT DIDNOT SEE PRINT WAS A MATTER OF SMALL MOMENT WITH HIM THE WRITING OF ITWAS THE CULMINATING ACT OF A LONG MENTAL PROCESS THE DRAWING TOGETHEROF SCATTERED THREADS OF THOUGHT AND THE FINAL GENERALIZING UPON ALL THEDATA WITH WHICH HIS MIND WAS BURDENED TO WRITE SUCH AN ARTICLE WAS THECONSCIOUS EFFORT BY WHICH HE FREED HIS MIND AND MADE IT READY FOR FRESHMATERIAL AND PROBLEMS IT WAS IN A
